So it appears that the iPhone app displayed my sites for the first little bit, but now just shows the "Grid Loading" icon. After about a minute, it stops acting like its loading and just displays the Grid logo. Android app just shows 1 of the 3 sites I have created. Admittedly, I have not added content to 2 of the sites, so hopefully it will show the others after content is created. I did create the other 2 sites in the Chrome browser add-on, which I think I will try and create my next one from mobile. Unless I am missing something, it appears there is not a way to create a post from the mobile apps on either platform, you can only edit previously posted content. All in all, considering The Grid is still in Beta, it does have great potential.
